  about_me: `
    My coding journey began with robotics, where I discovered the power of programming to bring machines to life. In 10th grade, as captain and lead programmer , I led my team to a national championship victory and proudly represented India at the FIRST FLL International Robotics Competition in Detroit.
    
    This not only sparked my love for technology but also taught me invaluable lessons in teamwork, problem-solving, and innovation. In college, I built on this foundation, honing my skills to develop scalable applications using technologies like ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, and Flask. My curiosity for learning continues to grow, and I’ve recently ventured into cloud computing, exploring tools like AWS and Docker.
    
    I am always eager to collaborate on challenging projects that push the boundaries of innovation. I always strive to make a meaningful impact with every project I undertake.
    
    When I’m not coding, you’ll often find me immersed in books, playing football, exploring new places, or gaming.
